# PacMan
PacMan game developed in java,


This is my first java game that is built from scratch.
Just to learn about the working of a game with minimal referrences.

In this game i have added a map generator with which we can generate custom maps we can customise mostly anything.
Like number of ghosts pac balls place of pac balls, gahost and pac man 

Added pac pellets 
Added multiple behaviors to ghosts.

Feel free to correct the bugs i  do have some problems reguarding to the movement of ghosts and pacman.
